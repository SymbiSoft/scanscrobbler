## Introduction ##

Frustrated with the lack of a way to scrobble CD's I had listened to on my stereo, I was thrilled when the [Universal Scrobbler](http://lastfmstats.livefrombmore.com/universalscrobbler/) came along. But I wanted a way to scrobble whilst at the stereo, without having to open a laptop.

## Details ##

I did find myself wishing for a way to scrobble on the spot of the CD player though, without needing to open the laptop and remember what I'd played at a later date. I thought it must be possible to just scan a CD barcode, get the track details and scrobble that.

Initially, I had planned to write an application in arduino/processing and develop a hardware solution, but some of the expertise needed for this was slightly beyond me at the time. I discovered that you could write apps for Symbian Series 60 phones in python, and so took a closer look.

With a bit of poking around, (I'm not much of a coder really, I just hack stuff around until it works, and I'd only amended one python script previously, some time ago) I have managed to come up with this scanner scrobbler script.
